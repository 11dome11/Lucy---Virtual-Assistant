# Lucy - Virtual Assistant

I built this virtual assistant with speech recognition. She can talk! There is no ai but she can do many things! Like send whatsapp messages(to send whatsapp messages you need google chrome and whatsappweb), listen and write a note in txt format, search on wikipedia, search for places on google maps, open all sorts of url, give weather information, set an alarm and many more. Everything has been implemented in Italian but can be easily changed
