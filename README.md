# Lucy - Virtual Assistant

I built this virtual assistant with speech recognition. She can talk! There is no ai but she can do many things! Like listen and write a note in txt format, search on wikipedia, search for places on google maps, open all sorts of url, set an alarm and many more. Everything has been implemented in Italian but can be easily changed

Library used:
